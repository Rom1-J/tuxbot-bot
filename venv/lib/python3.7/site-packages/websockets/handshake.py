"""
The :mod:`websockets.handshake` module deals with the WebSocket opening
handshake according to `section 4 of RFC 6455`_.

.. _section 4 of RFC 6455: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-4

Functions defined in this module manipulate HTTP headers. The ``headers``
argument must implement ``get`` and ``__setitem__`` and ``get`` â€”  a small
subset of the :class:`~collections.abc.MutableMapping` abstract base class.

Headers names and values are :class:`str` objects containing only ASCII
characters.

Some checks cannot be performed because they depend too much on the
context; instead, they're documented below.

To accept a connection, a server must:

- Read the request, check that the method is GET, and check the headers with
  :func:`check_request`,
- Send a 101 response to the client with the headers created by
  :func:`build_response` if the request is valid; otherwise, send an
  appropriate HTTP error code.

To open a connection, a client must:

- Send a GET request to the server with the headers created by
  :func:`build_request`,
- Read the response, check that the status code is 101, and check the headers
  with :func:`check_response`.
